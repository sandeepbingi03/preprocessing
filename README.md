**Use Case Document: Importance of Data Preprocessing for Multiple LLM Use Cases**

## **1. Introduction**
Large Language Models (LLMs) require clean, structured, and high-quality data for optimal performance. Raw data often contains redundant, noisy, or improperly formatted elements, making preprocessing a crucial step in ensuring model efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability. This document explores the importance of data preprocessing for various LLM use cases and provides an in-depth explanation of a Python-based preprocessing pipeline implemented to prepare JSONL files from raw CSV logs.

## **2. Importance of Data Preprocessing for LLM Use Cases**

### **2.1. Enhancing Data Quality**
- Removes irrelevant or redundant information.
- Standardizes format and renames key attributes.
- Fills missing values to maintain consistency.

### **2.2. Improving Model Performance**
- Reduces noise, leading to better accuracy in language tasks.
- Speeds up training and inference by eliminating unnecessary data.
- Helps prevent model biases by ensuring structured data.

### **2.3. Enabling Multi-Use Applications**
- Structured logs allow LLMs to be used for:
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Extracting and analyzing logs.
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying trends in error messages.
  - **Data Insights & Summarization**: Converting raw logs into human-readable reports.
  - **Automation & Chatbot Enhancement**: Feeding clean data for better decision-making.

## **3. Overview of the Data Preprocessing Pipeline**
This pipeline converts raw CSV logs into structured JSONL files, filtering only the relevant data for LLM processing.

### **3.1. Key Steps**
1. **Extracting `_raw` column**: Converts CSV logs into JSONL format while keeping only the `_raw` data.
2. **Preprocessing JSONL Files**: Cleans, structures, and filters essential attributes.
3. **Renaming and Formatting**: Maps key fields to standardized names.
4. **Saving Processed Data Separately**: Ensures raw and processed data are stored in distinct locations.

## **4. Code Explanation**

### **4.1. Folder Structure and Setup**
```python
CSV_FOLDER = "C:/Users/Desktop/LLM Logs/test"
JSONL_FOLDER = "C:/Users/Desktop/LLM Logs/jsonl_output"
PREPROCESSED_FOLDER = "C:/Users/Desktop/LLM Logs/preprocessed_jsonl"
PROCESSED_LOG = "C:/Users/Desktop/LLM Logs/processed_files.txt"
```
- `CSV_FOLDER`: Contains raw CSV logs.
- `JSONL_FOLDER`: Stores intermediate JSONL files before processing.
- `PREPROCESSED_FOLDER`: Stores final cleaned JSONL files.
- `PROCESSED_LOG`: Tracks processed files to avoid reprocessing.

### **4.2. CSV to JSONL Conversion**
```python
def convert_csv_to_jsonl(csv_file, jsonl_file):
    """Convert CSV to JSONL format, keeping only the '_raw' column."""
    with open(csv_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as infile, open(jsonl_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as outfile:
        reader = csv.DictReader(infile)
        for row in reader:
            if "_raw" in row and row["_raw"].strip():
                json.dump({"_raw": row["_raw"]}, outfile)
                outfile.write("\n")
```
- Reads CSV files and extracts only the `_raw` column.
- Writes `_raw` values into JSONL format.

### **4.3. Preprocessing JSONL Files**
```python
def preprocess_jsonl(input_file, output_file):
    """Process JSONL to extract only key_order keys from '_raw'."""
    with open(input_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as infile, open(output_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as outfile:
        for line in infile:
            try:
                record = json.loads(line)
                if "_raw" not in record:
                    continue

                raw_data = json.loads(record["_raw"]) if "_raw" in record else {}
                data = {}

                # Extract required fields from msg
                if "msg" in raw_data and isinstance(raw_data["msg"], dict):
                    for old_key, new_key in key_rename.items():
                        if old_key.startswith("msg.") and old_key.split("msg.")[1] in raw_data["msg"]:
                            msg_key = old_key.split("msg.")[1]
                            data[new_key] = raw_data["msg"].get(msg_key, "N/A")

                # Extract top-level fields
                for old_key, new_key in key_rename.items():
                    if not old_key.startswith("msg.") and old_key in raw_data:
                        data[new_key] = raw_data.get(old_key, "N/A")

                # Save only key_order fields
                filtered_data = OrderedDict((key, data.get(key, "N/A")) for key in key_order)
                outfile.write(json.dumps(filtered_data) + "\n")
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                continue
```
- Extracts relevant fields from `_raw`.
- Renames keys based on `key_rename`.
- Ensures missing fields are filled with `"N/A"`.
- Saves only the required keys in an ordered format.

### **4.4. Processing the Folder**
```python
def process_folder():
    """Convert CSVs to JSONL, then preprocess JSONL files."""
    processed_files = get_processed_files()
    for filename in os.listdir(CSV_FOLDER):
        if filename.endswith(".csv") and filename not in processed_files:
            csv_path = os.path.join(CSV_FOLDER, filename)
            jsonl_path = os.path.join(JSONL_FOLDER, filename.replace(".csv", ".jsonl"))
            output_path = os.path.join(PREPROCESSED_FOLDER, filename.replace(".csv", "_processed.jsonl"))
            
            convert_csv_to_jsonl(csv_path, jsonl_path)
            preprocess_jsonl(jsonl_path, output_path)
            log_processed_file(filename)
```
- Loops through CSV files, converting and preprocessing them.
- Saves final processed JSONL files in `PREPROCESSED_FOLDER/`.
- Ensures processed files are logged to avoid duplication.
